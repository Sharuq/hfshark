# Find Converted Customers

This is a small program which prints out a list of all customers for which at least one sale is recorded. 
Customer and sales data is provided via services module


This is meant to demonstrate some familiarity with:

* Git/Github
* Javascript
* Running/ Testing the program
* Working with async functions


# Steps for solution
1. Work out how to download/clone the repo
2. Work out how to run the program (all the files necessary are in this repo)
3. Look at any documentation to work out the correct operation
4. Write remaining code
5. Compare the actual output with the expected output
6. Write Tests
(BONUS POINTS!) How would you improve this function's performance?
